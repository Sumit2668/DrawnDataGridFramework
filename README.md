# Drawn DataGrid Framework

This is a framework for building grid controls that draw their
cell contents.

Because the approach of this project prevents it from hosting
Xamarin.Forms.View objects within cells, and because of current
difficulties
in getting a truly high-performance cross-platform drawing API
on all three Xamarin.Forms platforms (insert unhappy face aimed at
Windows Phone here), I have stopped work on this
project for the time being.

However, I am currently working on *another* DataGrid implementation,
implemented with a different approach.  Sorry, nothing from my
second attempt at a DataGrid has been released publicly yet.
Watch my blog and Twitter for announcements.

For more info on the code here in this repo, see my original blog post about it: [http://ericsink.com/entries/datagrid\_preview.html](http://ericsink.com/entries/datagrid_preview.html).
